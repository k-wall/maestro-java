# How many messages to send as warm-up
# warm-up.message.count=1000000
#
#
# The amount of time that maestro client waits for a response from the
# peers, when using a time-based duration for the tests, is determined
# by the duration of said test versus the multiplier given below (ie.:
# for 1m test, it waits as much as 2m for a response from the peers).
# duration.time.wait.multiplier=2
#
#
# The amount of time that maestro client waits for a response from the
# peers, when using a count-based duration for the tests, is determined
# by the calculated time of sending the warm-up count of messages divided
# by the given rate for the test, plus the base below. For example, for a
# warm-up of 1000000 messages sending 10k msgs/sec as the warm, the
# estimated duration would be 100 seconds + the base below, therefore
# totalling 190 seconds of wait time. For unbounded rate tests, defaults
# to the base value (90).
# duration.count.wait.base=90


# The warm up rate is calculated as a percent of the actual test rate.
# By default, the warm-up rate uses 30% of the given rate (when the test
# is using a fixed rate > 0). To adjust the warm-up rate value, change
# the setting below (ideally, it should be between 10 and 90).
# warm-up.rate.percent=30


# Cool down period, in seconds, between warm-up and test execution for
# fixed rate tests
# test.fixedrate.cooldown.period=1


# Default wait time, in seconds, for the workers to flush their data
# test.post.processing.wait.time=3
